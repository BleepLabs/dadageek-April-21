  // The audio library uses blocks of a set size so this is not a percentage or kilobytes, just a kind of arbitrary number.
  // On our Teensy 4.1 we can go up to almost 2000 but that won't leave any RAM for anyone else.
  // It's usually the delay and reverb that hog it.

  //This next group can be done anywhere in the code but we want to start things with these

  // A gain of 1 means the output is the same as the input.
  // .5 would be half volume and 2 would be double
  // -1.0 would mean the same volume but the signal is upside down, aka 180 degrees out of phase

  //Since we have two oscillators coming in that are already "1" We should take them down by half so we don't clip.
  // but the filter needs some headroom for the resonance so we'll take it down a bit more
  // If you go over "1" The top or bottom of the wave is just slammed against a wall
